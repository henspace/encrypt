# About

The encrypt-decrypt form is a simple encryption tool designed to simplify the encryption of text using the AES 256 algorithm. The code is open source, so feel free to check it out and see how it works.

The code hasn't been obfuscated so you can easily view the source code in your browser. If this is the sort of thing you're interested in, go to [Encrypt-decrypt on GitHub](https://github.com/henspace/encrypt-decrypt).

Code is encrypted using a password and, if you want, an additional key file. This additional key is combined with the password, so if you want to decrypt the text, you will need both the password and key file. Of course, you can encrypt without the need for an additional file.
