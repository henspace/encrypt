# About

The encrypt-decrypt form is a simple encryption tool designed to simplify the encryption of text using the AES 256 algorithm. The code is open source, so feel free to check it out and see how it works. You can find the code at [Encrypt-decrypt on GitHub](https://github.com/henspace/encrypt-decrypt).

You can also view the source code in your browser. In Chrome, right-click on the form and select _View page source_ or use _CtrlÂ U_. The code hasn't been compressed or obfuscated, so you can easily look at what's going on.

On the form, the text you supply is encrypted using a password and, if you want, an additional key file. This additional key is combined with the password, so if you want to decrypt the text, you will need both the password and key file. Of course, you can encrypt without the need for an additional file.
