# Privacy

The encrypt-decrypt form runs entirely client-side. Although it is available online, you can save the file locally and run without any internet connection at all. The file is entirely self-contained with no external dependencies.

- No data you enter is sent to the server.
- No cookies or data are saved on your device.
- No adverts are served.
- If you download the file and run it locally, no personal information is collected at all.
- If you run the file online, the form is served from a GitHub Pages site. When a GitHub Pages site is visited, your IP address is logged and stored for security purposes, regardless of whether or not you have signed into GitHub. This is common practice. For more information about GitHub's security practices, check out the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).
